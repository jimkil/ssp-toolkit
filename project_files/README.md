# Auto-generated System Security Plan (SSP)

## Overview

This repository contains documents that can be used to create and maintain a System Security Plan (SSP)
as required by the
[Risk Management Framework (RMF) version 1](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-37/rev-1/archive/2014-06-05).
Included are examples of SSP "front matter", control implementation statements (as defined in
[NIST SP 800-53r5](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev5/) along with the Privacy Overlay), and a
collection of appendices.

We understand that version 2 of the [Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy (RMFv2)](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-37/rev-2/final)
has been released, and we are planning to update this repository to include the controls as
defined in
[NIST SP 800-53r5 (draft)](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/draft) as
this is finalized.

Control templates are in machine-readable ([OpenControl](https://github.com/opencontrol/)) YAML
files. The intention is to enable these files to be updated automatically by gathering evidence
on the state of the running system.

### System Security Plan sections

A current version can be viewed in Git Markdown from this repository:

* [Front matter](frontmatter) (points of contact, system and technical description, ...)
* [Control implementation statements](docs/controls.md)
* [Appendices](appendices) (incident response, configuration management, regulations, ...)
