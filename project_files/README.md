# Auto-generated System Security Plan (SSP)

## Overview

This repository is created and managed by the [SSP Toolkit](github.com/CivicActions/ssp-toolkit).
It contains documents that can be used to create and maintain a System Security Plan (SSP)
as required by the [Risk Management Framework (RMF) version 1](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-37/rev-1/archive/2014-06-05).
Included are front matter, control implementation statements, as defined in
[NIST SP 800-53r5](https://nvd.nist.gov/800-53/Rev5/), and a collection of appendices.

Control templates are machine-readable ([OpenControl](https://github.com/opencontrol/)) YAML
files. From these templates we generate the control implementation statements, and the supporting
documentation for the creation of an SSP.
